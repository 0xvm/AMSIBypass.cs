# AMSIBypass.cs
yet another amsi.dll

This is an AmsiBypass.cs that you can drop in any project that uses @Cn33liz AMSI dll hijacking code as documented in [1].
The produced dll is functionally the same, with a bit of binary editing to throw off Windows Defender.

For example in these two awesome projects: 
- [@Cn33liz](https://github.com/Cn33liz) [p0wnedShell](https://github.com/Cn33liz/p0wnedShell)
- [@padovah4ck](https://github.com/padovah4ck) [PSByPassCLM](https://github.com/padovah4ck/PSByPassCLM)
